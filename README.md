# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

The following website showcases an inquiry tool for the results of over 600 participants in a study to identify the bacteria found in their belly buttons. Here, the participants as well as researchers may look for any specific ID from the dropdown menu and figure out their top bacterial fauna. They may also find a better breakdown of the type of bacteria found in their navels. Finally, we also provide a gauge that shows the average wash frequency. Researchers and participants may use this information as they see fit.
